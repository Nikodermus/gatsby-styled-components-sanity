# Another Gatsby Boilerplate (by Nikodermus)

A _very_ opinionated boilerplate for creating sites with Gatsby, that focus on 3 main things. [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [CSS Variable System](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/06/css-variables-design-systems/)

## 🐎 Before We Start

1. Create your [Sanity project](https://www.sanity.io/syntax)
1. Uncomment in `gatsby-config.js` the `Sanity` plugin and include your `projectId`.
1. Search for `REPLACE_ME` and change accordingly in all files.
1. Include your site or brand colors in `src/constants/site.js`, this will auto-generate the corresponding CSS variables.
1. Replace `static/images/favicon.png` for your own.
1. Include your fonts in `static/images` and link the `@font-face` in `static/images/fonts.css`.
1. Go ahead and delete [Before We Start](#-before-we-start) and [Creating a Project](#-creating-a-project) from your `README.md`.

### `Layout.jsx`

This component is used to share elements beween pages, you can find it in `src/components/Library/molecules/Layout.jsx`, you can extend it to include what you want to appear in all pages. `Nav` and `Footer` are already included.

### Global Context (Store)

This project also has a context set up between pages, it won't be lost between page changes, the context definition is in `src/utils/context.js` and you can use it easily with a custom hooks already provided there.

#### `useGlobalContext`

```jsx
// Use dispatch and actions, similar to Redux
import { ACTION_TYPES } from 'src/utils/context.js';

const Component = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useGlobalContext();

    return (
        <div>
            <code>{JSON.stringify(state)}</code>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(ACTION_TYPES.RESET)}>
                Reset State
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

#### `useMediaChange`

```jsx
// Change your definition of desktop
import { BREAKPOINTS } from 'src/constants/styled.js';

const Component = () => {
    //  The message is encoded and ready to send with Whatsapp Web API
    // The method changes based on mobile/desktop
    const { isDesktop, isMobile } = useMediaChange();

    return (
        <p>
            {isDekstop && `If it's more than ${BREAKPOINTS.desktop}.`}
            {isMobile && `It's always the opposite of "isDesktop"`}
        </p>
    );
};
```

### Hooks

There are a few hooks included, you can delete them or include yours in `src/utils/hooks`

#### `useClickOutside`

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const ref = useRef(null);

    // Pass a ref and a callback
    useClickOutside(ref, () => {
        console.log('Clicked outside!');
    });

    return (
        <div style={{ padding: '13rem' }}>
            <button ref={ref} onClick={() => console.log('Clicked inside')}>
                I'm the ref!
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

#### `useScrollDisabled`

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    // Pass initial value
    // false = scroll works
    const [setDisabled] = useScrollDisabled(false);

    return (
        <>
            <button onClick={() => setDisabled(true)}>Scroll disabled</button>
            <button onClick={() => setDisabled(false)}>Scroll enabled</button>
        </>
    );
};
```

#### `useWhatsappMessage`

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    // The message is encoded and ready to send with Whatsapp Web API
    // The method changes based on mobile/desktop
    // This uses the `useMediaChange` hook under the hood
    const message = useWhatsappMessage('I would like a hot-dog 🌭');

    return <a href={message}>Ask for food</a>;
};
```

# Run all .spec and .test files inside tests/components and tests/unit
yarn test
```
